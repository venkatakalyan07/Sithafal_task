# Sithafal_task
This Python script combines web crawling, embedding generation, similarity search, and OpenAI's GPT for creating a retrieval-augmented response generation system. Below is an explanation and notes for each component of the script:

Functionality Overview Validation of OpenAI API Key:

Ensures the OpenAI API key is valid and exits gracefully if it's not. Web Crawling & Scraping:

Uses requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape paragraphs and headers from specified URLs. Chunk Processing & Vector Embedding:

Splits scraped content into chunks. Converts each chunk into embeddings using SentenceTransformers. Stores the embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity-based retrieval. Query Handling:

Transforms user queries into embeddings and retrieves the top 3 most similar chunks from the FAISS index. Response Generation:

Combines the retrieved chunks as context for the OpenAI GPT model. Implements robust retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limits or API errors. Interactive CLI:

Allows users to ask questions interactively. The system retrieves relevant content and generates responses. Key Features Efficient Similarity Search:

Uses FAISS to store and retrieve embeddings, making the system scalable for large datasets. Retry Logic:

Handles OpenAI API rate limits and transient errors using exponential backoff. Content Scraping:

Dynamically crawls websites to collect data, making it adaptable to various sources. How to Use Install Required Libraries: Run the following command to install the dependencies:

bash Copy code pip install requests beautifulsoup4 faiss-cpu sentence-transformers openai Replace the API Key:

Update the openai.api_key with your actual OpenAI API key. Specify URLs:

Update the urls list with the websites you want to scrape. Run the Script: Execute the script using:

bash Copy code python script_name.py Ask Questions:

Once the system is ready, type your questions interactively. Exit:

Type exit or quit to terminate the system. Example Input: URL: https://example.com (replace with an actual website URL) Query: "What is the most important information on this page?" Output: Scraped Content: Extracted text chunks stored in FAISS. Response: A coherent answer generated by OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo using the retrieved chunks. Potential Enhancements Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize scraped text to improve embedding quality. Chunking Logic: Implement better chunking logic based on semantic boundaries (e.g., splitting at paragraphs or sentences). Scalability: Use a larger embedding model or vector database if handling a high volume of data. Integration with PDF Parsing: Combine this script with PDF extraction tools to handle documents directly. UI Integration: Build a web-based UI for ease of use. Notes Rate Limits: OpenAI's API usage is limited. Ensure proper handling with delays or consider upgrading your plan for high usage. Ethical Use: Ensure compliance with copyright and usage policies when scraping websites. Security: Avoid hardcoding sensitive keys like the API key in production. Use environment variables instead.
